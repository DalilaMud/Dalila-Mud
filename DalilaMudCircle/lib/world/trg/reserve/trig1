say Life it seems, will fade away
wait 3 sec
say Drifting further every day 
wait 3 sec
say Getting lost within myself 
wait 3 sec
say Nothing matters no one else 
wait 6 sec
say I have lost the will to live 
wait 3 sec
say Simply nothing more to give 
wait 3 sec
say There is nothing more for me 
wait 3 sec
say Need the end to set me free 
wait 10 sec
say Things not what they used to be 
wait 3 sec
say Missing one inside of me
wait 3 sec
say Deathly lost, this cant be real
wait 3 sec
say Cannot stand this hell I feel 
wait 3 sec
say Emptiness is filling me 
wait 3 sec
say To the point of agony 
wait 3 sec
say Growing darkness taking dawn
wait 3 sec
say I was me, but not hes gone
wait 20 sec
say No one but me can save myself, but its too late
wait 3 sec
say Now I can think, think why I should even try 
wait 10 sec
say Yesterday seems as though it never existed 
wait 3 sec
say Death Greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
