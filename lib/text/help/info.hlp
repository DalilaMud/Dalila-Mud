AC

"AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -10 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:


  AC  Roughly equivalent to
-----------------------------------------------------------
  10  Naked person
   0  Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -10  Armored battle tank

The score command displays your armor class as a number such as 78/10;
this means 78 on a scale from -100 to 100 (i.e., 7.8 on the scale from
-10 to 10.)

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

#
CAW

The Curious Area Workshop was created for the creation and
distribution of DikuMud areas to the public.

Why?

The individuals involved in the initial creation of C.A.W. were tired
of seeing their work disappear on muds that come and go as quickly as
a summer rain.  C.A.W. gives them, and others, the chance to
distribute their efforts to the general community -- a chance to give
back to the mudding community in a small way.

Would you like to see us personally on your mud?  You won't.  We don't
want free wizzes/favors for our work here.  In fact, we will state
categorically that if anyone comes on your mud claiming to be
associated with us, they aren't.

There is one exception, one only.  Caw exists as an entity on VieMud,
our pre-release testing grounds.  If you need to get in contact with
us for any reason, you can reach us on VieMud (viemud.org 4000), directly
at <fletcher@democracy.queensu.ca>, or at our web page at:

         http://democracy.queensu.ca/~fletcher/VieMud/Caw/

We welcome criticism, ideas, challenges, bug/typo reports, and advice.
If you use one of our areas in your mud, or want to be put on our
mailing list for updates, announcements, and errata, drop us a line!

#
CLERIC

Clerics have an ancient belief in not carrying sharp weapons.  Hence, they can
only wield bludgeoning weapons.  This class gives you the wisdom of peace,
blessing and healing, though it is possible to learn more violent spells.

You can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See 'help spells' for a list of spells available.

#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

#
FLAGS

Players sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

  FLAG        MEANING
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  (KILLER)    Player is trying to kill other players.  That means you
              can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
  (THIEF)     Player is trying to steal from other players.  Fire away.
  (invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are
              sensitive to the presence of invisible things.
  (writing)   Player is writing on the board; do not disturb.
  (mailing)   Player is writing mail; do not disturb.
  (deaf)      Player has chosen not to hear shouts.
  (notell)    Player has chosen not to accept tells.
  (quest)     Player is participating in a quest currently being run by
              the Gods.

#
GUILD

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world.  Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building.  Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade.

See also: PRACTICE
#
HOUSES

Houses have been implemented as of CircleMUD 3.0.  A house entails two things:
access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house and
quit; your objects will drop to the ground and be crash-saved for when you
return.  There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be
stored in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher
premium for the convenience of houses; contact your local Implementor for
a fee schedule.

IMPLEMENTOR

The most powerful being in existence.
#
INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#
"MAGIC USER" WIZARD MAGE

This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user do not
control the nature, and can therefore not bless and such.

You can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See 'help spells' for a list of spells available.

See also: PRACTICE, SPELLS
#
MANA

Mana is used when casting spells.  You must have a certain amount of mana
in order to cast any particular spell.  If you do not have enough mana to
cast the spell you must rest until you gain enough points to cast.

PETS

You can buy pets to assist you, once you purchase the pet it will follow
you around obeying your ORDERs.  Just give it an order and it will perform
that command.  No information will be given back as to whether the command
actually worked or not, so you'll have to keep an eye on'em and see if he
did what you told'em to do...

Examples:

  > order wolf kill dragon
  > order wolf sleep
  > order puppy sing

See also: ORDER, SHOPS
#
SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

THIEF THIEVES

Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other class offers.
Their specialty tends to be in the darker, sneakier art.  Many of these
qualities can come in handy in many situations, such as picking locks.

You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

Skills available to thieves:

sneak, hide, steal, backstab, pick lock, track

See the help on each skill for more information.

#
WARRIOR FIGHTER

Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.  This makes
them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills of violence and
fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.  However, they lack the
ability to use magic of any sort.

You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

Skills available to warriors:

kick, rescue, track, bash

CIRCLE CIRCLEMUD CREDITS
                    C  I  R  C  L  E  M  U  D     3  .  0

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Alex Fletcher (Furry), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, and David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!
