ADVANCE

Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.

Example:

  > advance rasmussen 34

#
WIZAT

Usage: at <room VNUM | item | mob | player name> <command> <arguments>

AT can be used to perform an action in a location other than where you are
standing.  The first argument can be a virtual room number or the name of a
character or object.  The remainder of the line is passed to the command
interpreter.

Examples:

  > at 3001 look
  > at fido kill fido
  > at 3.corpse get all corpse
  > at catje wave catje

See also: GOTO
#
BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

See also: WIZLOCK
#
DATE

Shows the current real time. (Not a social)
#
DC

Usage: dc <descriptor number>

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket.  If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.

#
ECHO GECHO QECHO SEND

Usage: echo <message>
       gecho <message>
       send <victim> <message>
       qecho <message>

ECHO displays a string to everyone in your room.
GECHO displays the string to everyone in the game.
QECHO displays the string to everyone with the QUEST flag.
SEND displays the string to a particular person.

Examples:

  > echo Hi, everyone in the room.
  > gecho Hi, everyone in the game, isn't this annoying?
  > send rasmussen You are being watched.
#
FORCE

Usage: force <victim | all> <command> <arguments>

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

Example:

  > force fido drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look fido

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.
#
FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

See also: SET -> FROZEN
#
GOTO TRANS WIZTELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

A toggle which allows you to see:
   Invisible people and objects, even if you don't have 'detect invisibility'
   Hidden people, even if you don't have 'sense life'
   Dark rooms, even if you don't have a light

It is expected most immortals will keep HOLYLIGHT on most of the time;
it exists so that you have the ability to see what mortals see for
debugging purposes.
#
IMOTD

Displays the Immortal message of the day.  This file usually contains
new information on commands recently added, new features and other
important information that immortals should be aware of.

people at and above the level you specify will be able to see you.

Examples:

  > invis
  > invis 31

See also: VISIBLE

#
LOAD

Usage: load <mob | obj> <virtual number>

LOAD is used to create mobiles and objects.  The first argument specifies if
you are trying to load a mobile or an object; the second is the virtual
number.

Do not abuse this command.
#
PARDON

Usage: pardon <victim>

Removes killer and thief flags from a player.
#
POOFIN POOFOUT

Usage: poofin <message>
       poofout <message>

Sets the message seen by players when you use GOTO to move to a different
room.  POOFIN with no argument resets your poofin to the default "appears with
an ear-splitting bang"; POOFOUT with no argument defaults to "disappears in
a puff of smoke."

See also: GOTO
#
PURGE

Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

See also: DC
#
RELOAD

to be displayed next to room names.
#
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

#
SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

#
SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command; 
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.
#
SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.
#
STAT

Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people with
names such as Red or Cityguard.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the playerfile.

Examples:

  > stat fido
  > stat player red
  > stat mobile red
  > stat file niandra
  > stat object thunderbolt

See also: VSTAT
#
STRING

Usage: string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The
format is:

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.

Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently cannot be strung.
#
SWITCH

Usage: switch <monster>

SWITCH is used to take over the body of mobiles; useful for interactive
adventures.  If the monster in which you are switched is killed you will be
returned to your own body.

See also: RETURN
#
SYSLOG

Usage: syslog [off | brief | normal | complete]

The SYSLOG command controls how detailed of an on-line system log you see.
