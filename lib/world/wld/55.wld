   You are at the headwaters of what is oft called the darkest river
in the land.  Looking at the swampy water pooling in this rocky valley,
you can see why the water downstream is so dark.  The rock walls reach
up around you blocking all exits except that to the north up onto the
banks, and to the south where the river flows.

and north a wide open expanse of grass.  You can just barely make out
a road that seems to be traveling along side the river but the

Near The Shore~
   The road ends here turning into a small dirt path leading down the
beach and onto a dock.  To the north and south you see the coastline
stretching out before you.  West of here the lowlands roll up into
huge snow capped mountains.

On A Dock~
   You stand on a simple wooden dock that acts as an extension of the
road to the west.  The dock seems to have been here for quite a long
time but is still sturdy.  A small ladder has been built on the eastern
end to allow easy access to and from ships.

The Dragon Sea~
   You are on the clear blue seas of the Dragon Sea.  Water extends in
all directions as far as the eye can see.  Off in the distance you think
you might see a small dock to the west.

The Dragon Sea~
   The ocean spreads out in all directions rolling gently.  In the
distance you can see an island on the horizon.  To the west you see
the mainland.

Under The dock~
   You are swiming underneath the dock.  You can see the four wooden
pylons that support the structure.  The murky water clouds you vision
as you gaze westward, but you think you can make out an iron grating
in that direction.

The Lair Of The Ixitxachitl~
   Blood swirls around in the water as the Ixitxachitl devours the 
last of its meal.  Swirling around quickly as you intrude upon his
meal the large sting ray attacks!
